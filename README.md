# Groundwater Potential Zone Mapping for Sustainable Water Management in India

### Description
Given India's reliance on groundwater and the challenges of depletion and climatic stress, scientifically robust groundwater potential zone (GWPZ) mapping is critical. 
This paper reviews Indian GWPZ research, highlighting a methodological shift from traditional multi-criteria decision-making models towards advanced machine learning techniques, with validation commonly using ROC/AUC metrics. 
Despite these advancements, regional data heterogeneity, aquifer complexity, and climatic variability continue to pose significant challenges. 
The paper advocates for future strategies like high-resolution datasets and 3D subsurface modeling to improve sustainable groundwater management in India.

#### Global Aquifer Location Map
This world map highlights the geographic distribution of nine major aquifer systems using color-coded markers. Each aquifer is labeled clearly, and a legend is provided for visual reference. It provides a spatial understanding of where critical groundwater reserves are located globally.

#### Dual-Axis Depletion Rate Chart
This bar chart compares depletion rates of those aquifers in two forms: blue bars indicate the depth lost per year (mm/year), while red bars show the total volume depleted per year (kmÂ³/year). It reveals that Northwestern India and the Ogallala Aquifer experience the most severe groundwater loss both in depth and volume.
