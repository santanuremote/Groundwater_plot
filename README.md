# Groundwater_plot
1. Global Aquifer Location Map
This world map highlights the geographic distribution of nine major aquifer systems using color-coded markers. Each aquifer is labeled clearly, and a legend is provided for visual reference. It provides a spatial understanding of where critical groundwater reserves are located globally.

2. Dual-Axis Depletion Rate Chart
This bar chart compares depletion rates of those aquifers in two forms: blue bars indicate the depth lost per year (mm/year), while red bars show the total volume depleted per year (kmÂ³/year). It reveals that Northwestern India and the Ogallala Aquifer experience the most severe groundwater loss both in depth and volume.
